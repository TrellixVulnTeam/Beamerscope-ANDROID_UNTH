Machine-learned Phase-Contrast using a 3D printed microscope based on DPC
=========================================================================

Derived from code snippets used in the paper paper by Lei Tian, Jingyan Wang, and Laura Waller

The app takes a series of images, where the "Presentation API" from Android displays a specific pattern on a projector. The images are getting processed to feed a neural network trained in Tensorflow to produce an optimized illumination shape to enhance the phase contrast of an arbitrary object.
